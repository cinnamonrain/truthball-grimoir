<h2>ðŸ”‹ The Battery â€“ A Symbol of the Soul</h2>
<pre>
A battery is a storehouse of potential. It separates polarityâ€”positive and negativeâ€”
not as opposition, but as necessity for movement. The power comes not from what it
holds, but from the difference it maintains.

Like the human soul in the body: held between heaven and earth, between desire and discipline.
